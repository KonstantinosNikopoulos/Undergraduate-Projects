# Neural Network on MNIST with keras

### Author: Konstantinos Nikopoulos


##### Test and evaluate different activation functions.



1. Preprocess dataset   
Apply PCA for dimension reduction.     
new shape of data: (60000, 100) (10000, 100)   
new shape of labels: (60000, 10) (10000, 10)    

2. Construction of neural network   

2.1 Model architecture   
Neural network includes 2 hidden layers with 128 neurons each and an ouput layer with 10 neurons for classification.

2.2 Compile and train   
Loss function: mean squared error    
Optimizer: adam   
Batch size: 128    
Epochs: 50
