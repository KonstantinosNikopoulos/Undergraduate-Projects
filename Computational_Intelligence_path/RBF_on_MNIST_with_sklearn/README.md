##### Test parameters of RBF for regognition of even and odd numbers.   

1.Preprocess dataset   
Apply PCA for dimension reduction and divide even and odd numbers.   
new shape of data: (60000, 100) (10000, 100)   
new shape of labels: (60000, 2) (10000, 2)   

2. Clustering   

2.1 Clustering algorithm   
K-means with scikit learn.   

2.2 Κ clusters   
For Κ=20 clusters. Two for each digit (0,1,..,9).   

3. RBF   

3.1 Kernel   
Gaussian    
Kernels: linear and polynomial degree=3.   

3.2 Gamma   
Gamma= 0.1, 1 and 10.3   

4. MLP   

4.1 Neurons and hidden layers   
Test 1: Neural network includes 1 hidden layes with 100 neurons and an ouput layer with 2 neurons for classification.   
Test 2: Neural network includes 2 hidden layes with 50 neurons each and an ouput layer with 2 neurons for classification.   

4.2 Other parameters   
Activation function:  relu for hidden layers and softmax for output layer.   
Loss function: categorical crossentropy    
Optimizer: adam     
Epochs: 30
